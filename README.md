# marine-ml-pipeline
ML pipeline for wave data

## Simple ML Model
Defines a simple regression model to predict the wave height of one buoy based on the data from another.

> [!NOTE]
> The model is essentially a placeholder, to facilitate the ML pipeline build.

## Run

1. Activate virtual env, e.g. `./.venv/bin/activate`
2. Start mlflow: `uv run poe mlflow`
3. Start jupyter lab: `uv run poe jupy` and open and run `optuna.ipynb`
4. View model details in mlflow at http://localhost:5000
